    so i see you've tried to see where this small ARG stuff ends or maybe im just writing this to nobody. well in any case now i shall tell you about me.
    i am heroic. probably was.
    well actually i am shashwat raj.
    a guy from bihar.
    a very introvertish nerd in people's eyes.
    i have had fun on the internet with you guys but, i must leave.
    the pp tower in the minecraft server shall be wilbur's now.
    and eti, we wont be able to watch the rest of mob psycho.
    i have decided to leave the internet as heroic for atleast 6-7 months if not forever.
    there are several reasons.
    studies being one,
    addiction to my phone and games lol,
    i am sick of hiding my identity but i am all the same scared to reveal it much,
    i have lost many friends over the time for this reason.
    well, i cant keep on listing reasons.
    idk if i'll be able to leave.
    but i am for now........
